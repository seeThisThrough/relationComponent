# relationComponent
This is a relationalComponent I created as part of a team creating a product detail page. This component is RESTful and adheres
to the best practices for microservices. 

This component is full-stack and deployed using an AWS EC2 instance. Images saved through Docker

TechStack used include: React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, AWS-EC2, AWS-S3, Docker

to get started:
1. clone down repo
2. run npm setup
3. start node server
4. go to localhost

NOTE: This component is part of a microservice and contains code which run on dependencies from other microservices
